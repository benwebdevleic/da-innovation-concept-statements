            <h1>Gradspire</h1>
            <p>The world of graduate recruitment is complex and fast changing. To achieve employment goals, employers must be happy to adapt their strategies in an efficient and evidence-based way. Data plays a key part in informing this change but without key graduate insights, metrics and analysis, important trends might be missed.</p>
            <p>Gradspire asks students and graduates about their decision making, aspirations and capabilities offering key insights into their mind, goals and future ambitions, informing your recruitment strategy and narrowing the gap between employers and graduates thinking.</p>
            <p>Data collection is ongoing allowing trends in both aspirations and competencies to be analysed over time. This is linked to our database of graduate outcomes data showing trends in subject and employment.</p>
            <p>The data is visualised in different ways giving overviews, timelines, tables and more so you can explore the data in different ways appropriate to your needs. This is supported by additional content and insight such as blogs and podcasts.</p>
            <p>Gradspire helps connect the minds of graduates and employers, supporting the development of a clear, more informed, modern and effective recruitment strategy.</p>
