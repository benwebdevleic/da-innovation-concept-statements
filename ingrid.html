            <h1>Informed Graduate Recruitment Intelligence Dashboards (INGRID)</h1>
            <p>The world of graduate recruitment is complex and fast changing. To achieve employment goals, employers must be happy to adapt their strategies in an efficient and evidence-based way. Data plays a key part in informing this change but without centrally sourced data, insights and analysis, key insights may be missed.</p>
            <p>INGRID is a platform that allows easy consolidation of relevant graduate recruitment data to reduce the time it takes to go from data to insights.</p>
            <p>Our database contains specifically selected, cleansed and merged data from a variety of sources - strongly based around HESA's data - which is collected directly from HE providers and graduates.</p>
            <p>INGRID empowers users to analyze, visualize and create dashboards using the pre derived database as well as giving users access to pre derived insights and dashboards.</p>
            <p>INGRID helps to inform your graduate recruitment strategy using evidence-based data and insights.</p>
