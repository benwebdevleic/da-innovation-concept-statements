            <h1>Natural Language</h1>
            <p>The world of graduate recruitment is complex and fast changing. To achieve employment goals, employers must be happy to adapt their strategies in an efficient and evidence-based way.</p>
            <p>Data plays a key part in informing this change but without time and expertise to source and analyse the data, valuable insights might be missed.</p>
            <p>Natural language brings the power of data into all employees hands.</p>
            <p>Insights can be unlocked by users asking simple questions about any given dataset and the software will generate relevant visualisations.</p>
            <p>Our database contains specifically selected, cleansed and merged data from a variety of sources - strongly based around HESA's data - which is collected directly from HE providers and graduates. This natural language approach will help to empower experienced analysts and newcomers with little to no experience in the data world.</p>
